[Calculate Poll Results](https://michaelf314.github.io/calculate-poll-results/)

Calculate poll results from a collection of IMDb or iCheckMovies lists. Choose the files, and then click "Calculate results".

Each film receives points for every list it appears on, based on its rank and the half-life. For example, if the half-life is 50, the number of points is 100 / 2 ^ ((rank-1)/50).
